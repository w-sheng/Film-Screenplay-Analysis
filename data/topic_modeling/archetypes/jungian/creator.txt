The Creator (also called the Artist or Inventor) is characterized by self-expression. Creators are often non-conformists because theyâ€™re not motivated by fitting in but by interpreting the thoughts, feelings, objects and technologies of a society in new ways. Often the creations are works that others can perceive through their senses: music, visual arts, theater, or poetry. Sometimes the creations are technological innovations. They use their imaginations to create something that had not existed before and therefore are often agents of change. Doc Brown, the scientist who invents a time machine out of a DeLorian car in Back To The Future is a Creator archetype.
