The Jester offers an element of humor. The Jester lightens up tense situations and is often represented by small animals in Disney movies (think the snowman Olaf in Frozen). Jesters have a subtly powerful role: they often have access to Leaders and speak the truth when no one else dares to do so.

frivolity, wasting time
joy
