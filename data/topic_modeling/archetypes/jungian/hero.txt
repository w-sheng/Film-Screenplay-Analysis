The Hero is a character that proves him or herself through amazing physical acts. Though heroes are strong, their strength is controlled and they use it to benefit others. Main characters are often Hero archetypes. Because this is such a common archetype, there are a range of sub-categories. Harry Potter, for example, falls under the “reluctant hero.”
