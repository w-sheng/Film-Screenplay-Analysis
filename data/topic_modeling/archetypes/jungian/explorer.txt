Explorers learn what’s valuable or achieve growth through discovery. These archetypes can themselves unearth new concepts or objects, or they can challenge others to encounter new things or perform actions that have never been done before. From these pioneering, individuals and even societies can learn about themselves. Odysseus is the classic explorer archetype.

Don’t fence me in
the freedom to find out who you are through exploring the world
to experience a better, more authentic, more fulfilling life
journey, seeking out and experiencing new things, escape from boredom
aimless wandering, becoming a misfit
autonomy, ambition, being true to one’s soul
the seeker, iconoclast, wanderer, individualist, pilgrim.
