This character is all about physical enjoyment. Jessica Rabbit from Who Stole Roger Rabbit comes to mind. The Sensualist is also called the Lover. This archetype might be someone who gains pleasure through his or her senses — or someone who causes other characters to discover their own sensual capabilities. Because the sensualist’s dreamlike quality is easy for other characters to fall for, the Sensualist is often an agent of change or inspiration for the main protagonist.
