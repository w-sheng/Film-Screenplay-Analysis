The Maverick is also often called a rebel, outlaw, or rogue. Mavericks distance themselves from the establishment through defiance, disobedience, and nonconformity â€” and in so doing, achieve freedom, either for themselves or for a community in peril. Mavericks enjoy being a bad, either slightly or completely. Sometimes they even enjoy instilling fear in others. Hans Solo and Jack Sparrow are likeable Mavericks. Western movies and murder mysteries are full of dangerous Mavericks.
