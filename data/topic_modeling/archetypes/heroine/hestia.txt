The Mystic
A calm, gentle woman of simple tastes, who enjoys solitude and does not shy from basic household chores (a career doesn't much interest her); she needs to be creative and can be free-spirited, and she wants to do things for herself rather than be beholden to someone else.

The Betrayer
The Betrayer hides under an innocent shy mask. In reality, she is manipulative and only out for herself.
