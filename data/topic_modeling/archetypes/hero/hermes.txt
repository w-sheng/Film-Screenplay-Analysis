The Fool
A playful, carefree soul who enjoys his freedom and doesn't worry about consequences; he won't deliberately hurt others, but neither will he let himself be tied down to a relationship (and prison would be death to him).

The Derelict
A criminal who doesn't want to work within the parameters of law and decorum. He may think himself better than normal life, may have no problem with getting rich off of people's weaknesses, or be too lazy / dumb to work a 9-to-5 job, so he steals instead.
