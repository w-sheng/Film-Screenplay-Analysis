The Artist
A creative but emotionally volatile man who takes any criticism poorly (rejection is death to him); his behavior and reactions are not easily predicted, and even he may fear that he will harm those he loves.

The Abuser
A psychopathic and vengeful man who will not rest until he gets his revenge, no matter who gets hurt in the process. When someone has slighted him he likes to punish them in the worst possible way and thoroughly enjoys it. He's the kind of man who will beat his wife and then give her flowers and apologies and repeat the cycle. In his world, the only feelings that matter is his own.
