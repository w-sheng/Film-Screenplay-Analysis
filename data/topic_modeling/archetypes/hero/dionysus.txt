The Woman's Man
A fun-loving, sensual man who can't relate to masculine pastimes but revels in the company of women, who helps the women around him to find their courage and realize their own worth - although the Dionysus himself often feels flawed and may never find the perfect woman he seeks.

The Seducer
He does not respect women or want to help them, only use them for sex. He sees every new conquest as a trophy for himself. He doesn't care about the consequences of his actions and often over indulges in other things.
