The Protector
A physically oriented warrior who revels in competition and risk, defends his kin, and fears nothing anyone can do to him - except losing the ability to fully use his body (paralysis would be death to him).

The Gladiator
A warrior more concerned with battle and war than sportsmanship and protection. He fights for no one but himself, his pleasure in fighting, and will often pick war over peace with friends and family.
