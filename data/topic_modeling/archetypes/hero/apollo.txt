The Businessman
A logical, focused team player who is good at planning and enjoys performing his duties (unemployment is death to him) but poor at dealing with chaotic forces (including emotions and relationships).

The Traitor
A disillusioned or cynical team player who feels he can do the work better than his boss and back stabs him or, does evil in the name of his team, for the good of the team. The hero will either be the boss or a co-worker that wasn't aware of his team's corruption and the Traitor's eager role in aiding it.
